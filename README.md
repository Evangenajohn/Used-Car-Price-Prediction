## ðŸš— Car Price Prediction Model

This project predicts the selling price of used cars based on various features like brand, fuel type, kilometers driven, etc.

### âœ… Key Features:
- Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Feature Engineering (brand grouping, fuel simplification, car age, etc.)
- Outlier Removal
- Log Transformation of Target
- One-hot Encoding
- Linear Regression Model

### ðŸ§ª Final Result:
- **Model Used:** Linear Regression  
- **RÂ² Score:** ~76.5% (after feature engineering and cleaning)

### ðŸ“‚ How to Use:
1. Upload the dataset `CAR DETAILS FROM CAR DEKHO.csv`
2. Run the notebook step-by-step
3. Get predictions and visualize results

### ðŸ“Š Requirements:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
